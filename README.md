# Obsidian Image File Namer

Creates attachment file links for Obsidian notes. Best used in conjunction with either a batch file renamer (e.g. Bulk Rename for Windows)<br>
or the Paste Image Rename plugin for Obsidian.<br><br>
Currently offers only Wiki style links (e.g. `![[file]]`), but will add support for Markdown links (e.g. `![alias](filepath)`) soon, along with<br>
customisable filenames (right now the default & sole option is e.g. filename-1.ext).
